# Real-world data (RWD)/Real-world evidence (RWE)

**FDA Definitions:**

* **RWD:** *"Data relating to patient health status and/or the delivery of health care routinely collected from a variety of sources."*
* **RWE:** *"Clinical evidence about the usage and potential benefits of risks of a medical product derived from analysis of RWD."*
* **EUA:** *"Emergency Use Authorization"*

## Why focus on RWD/RWE? 
* New technology that generates lots of data 
* RWE complements and augments RCT 
* Unlike RCT, there are no exclusions 
* Capture diverse patient population 
* No protocols but follows people in real-life 

## Differences between RCT and RWD/E
*  No randomization
*  No blinded treatment
*  Diverse patients
*  Everyday life environment
*  approved/existing drug combination effects

## Information/sources of RWD: 
* Vs: Volume, Velocity (coming in quickly), Variety (of sources), Veracity, Value, Variability, Visualization and Virality (learning), Virtual (?)
* Outpatients visit data or provider data; emergency patient visits; medicare data; pharmacy data etc. 
  * Unit of analysis: person-level, provider-level, or prescription level or region-level (state, country, or other smaller units)
